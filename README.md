# Reach
##### A Sinatra web application for people to simplify the arduous process of reaching out for help by presetting text messages in a healthy mindset. When a person needs to reach out, they simply open the app and press the 'REACH' button. This solves the all too common problem of struggling to find the right words to say or talking yourself out of getting support in a time of crisis.
